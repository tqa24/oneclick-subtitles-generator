## From video to subtitles

Open a video or audio file, or paste a supported video URL. Generate subtitles with Gemini or an
optional local speech-recognition engine—or import an existing subtitle file and start editing.

- **Edit against the video.** Adjust text and timing on the waveform timeline, work on a selected
  range, and undo changes.
- **Translate and review.** Translate subtitles without leaving the editor, then save a subtitle
  file or continue to video export.
- **Style the result.** Choose fonts, placement, colors and effects with a video preview.
- **Add narration.** Generate speech with your chosen provider or downloadable local engine.

## Before you start

- **Windows x64 only.** No Node.js or development server needed. Video export requires a compatible
  Direct3D GPU and driver; software-only Windows VMs are not supported for native export.
- **Bring your own Gemini API keys** for Gemini features. Provider quotas, availability and charges
  apply. Optional local speech engines download separately and may need several GB of storage
  and suitable hardware.
- **Tools install when needed.** You do not need to set up FFmpeg, yt-dlp or Deno by hand.
- **Windows may show an unsigned-publisher warning.** The installer is not Authenticode-signed;
  in-app updates are verified separately with a signature.

Projects and settings stay on your machine. API keys use the operating-system credential store.
Cloud operations send the required media or text to the provider you choose—not every feature
works offline.

<summary>Coming from the old batch-file edition?</summary>

OSG 1.0.0 is the new native application, not an automatic downgrade from legacy 2.x.
Migration is manual; keep your old data until you have checked the import.
See the [migration guide](https://github.com/nganlinh4/oneclick-subtitles-generator/blob/rewrite/tauri-rust/docs/DEVELOPMENT.md#data-and-migration).

The [v2.6.1 release](https://github.com/nganlinh4/oneclick-subtitles-generator/releases/tag/v2.6.1)
and its [Windows batch installer](https://github.com/nganlinh4/oneclick-subtitles-generator/releases/download/v2.6.1/OSG_installer_Windows.bat)
remain available. The generic Latest link now points to native OSG.

<summary>Build from source</summary>

Native development lives on **`rewrite/tauri-rust`**. For now, `main` keeps the legacy application
code so existing batch-file users are not broken.

Install the prerequisites in the [development guide](https://github.com/nganlinh4/oneclick-subtitles-generator/blob/rewrite/tauri-rust/docs/DEVELOPMENT.md), then:

```powershell
git fetch origin
git switch rewrite/tauri-rust
npm ci
npm --prefix apps/desktop ci
npm run tauri:dev
```

Use the managed launch command, not the debug executable alone: it starts the development server too.
